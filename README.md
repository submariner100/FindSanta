# FindSanta
Small iPhone application for tracking Santa on Christmas Eve as he flies around the world delivering presents to the children.

1.  This Application was written by Michael Helmbrecht and was posted on the Realm website. It has been adapted by myself and I have
    added new images etc.
2.  This application is a great introduction to the two products I made. The Realm Mobile Database for data perstistence & handling,
    and the Realm Mobile Platform for syncing.
3.  Initial commit - connecting to Realm, designing UI, importing MapKit, and creating class files for Santa, Location, Map Manager.
